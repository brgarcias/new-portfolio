      My mother worked as a teaching assistant at the school, which made it possible for 
      me to attend on a full scholarship. This excellent school played a pivotal role in my 
      early development, imparting a variety of values and fundamental principles crucial 
      for a child's growth.`,

      me in preparing for exams and practice tests, including the ENEM and FUVEST. After completing
      high school, I spent one year in a preparatory course at ETAPA. I successfully passed the first
      phase of the FUVEST, but unfortunately, I didn't make it through the second phase.`,

    content: `Although I completed my studies at São Judas Tadeu University, I began my undergraduate education in
      2018 at Anhembi Morumbi University, majoring in Computer Engineering. I really enjoyed the program and
      the university's excellent facilities, and my studies were progressing well. However, after the first
      semester, the tuition fees became prohibitively high, and I didn't have the financial resources to continue.
      So, in mid-2018, I transferred to São Judas Tadeu University and switched to the Computer Science program,
      ultimately graduating in the first semester of 2022.`,
